cpan2rpm is an old, and very helpful, tool for building RPM's from
CPAN perl modules. It uses the standard RPM file structure and creates
a spec file, a source RPM, and a binary, leaving these in their
respective directories.

The modified cpan2rpm.spec file adds some missing dependencies, for
tools like perl-libwww-perl, perl(ExtUtils::MakeMaker), and fakeroot.

It's also been modified with INSTALL_BASE set to get installations in
/usr instead of /usr/local.
